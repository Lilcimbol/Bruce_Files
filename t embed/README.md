The T-Embed CC1101 is a compact, handheld development board that combines the power of the Espressif ESP32 microcontroller with an integrated CC1101 sub-1GHz RF transceiver. Designed for wireless experimentation, security research, and IoT development, it features a 1.54-inch display, built-in buttons, and USB-C for power and programming. The CC1101 module allows the T-Embed to send and receive signals across various sub-GHz frequencies (typically 315, 433, 868, and 915 MHz), making it ideal for exploring RF communications like remote controls, sensors, and other low-power wireless systems.
